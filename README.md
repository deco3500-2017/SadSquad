# StudyHub


## Introduction: 
StudyHub is a project which intends to address the problem of the overwhelming amount of resources available to students, with all unique purposes. The current landscape of applications which students use creates a variety of problems such as; multiple accounts, passwords, and confusion on the location of resources and announcements. This project plans to address this by linking these educational applications together into an easy interface where students are able to access all resources available to them. Which should result in more peer collaboration, such as sharing of past exam answers, better access to material supplied by the administrators and creating a space for effective group work. 




## Concept


StudyHub is every student's best friend. StudyHub is a centralised place of learning for students studying at university or higher education. StudyHub facilitates collaboration and discussion amongst university peers. From StudyHub users can easily access external resources from different platforms that they have already signed up to such as: Slack, Piazza, UQ Attic, GitHub, Trello and many more. StudyHub is also a perfect place for students to privately work on group assignments together. 

Students are sick of having to remember so many different passwords and usernames for their many different accounts. StudyHub keeps all of their accounts in one place; eliminating the need for students to have to try and remember different usernames and passwords for their Slack, Piazza, UQ Attic, GitHub, Trello and many more. StudyHub stores your account information and provides links to these websites and other helpful resources. 

We aim for StudyHub to operate as a base of operations for students to do group work and facilitates class discussion. Many students find it hard to discuss class subject matter and topics with their peers as they do not know anyone in the course. StudyHub will facilitate discussion within courses; allowing people in the same course to: connect, ask each other questions, collaborate on group projects and work efficiently together. 

StudyHub is a web based application where university students can collaborate, catch up on work and study together. StudyHub provides easy access to all the resources a student needs while studying a university degree or higher education. Our aim is to provide an easy to use platform that students will use to improve their study and university experience. StudyHub is a central place for students to revise, help other students and collaborate on group work. StudyHub is especially useful for students who do not know anyone in their course/degree or are struggling with topics. 
 
In StudyHub, students can sign up for each of their subjects. Selecting one of the subjects will redirect the student to the course page for that particular subject. Here there is a central course discussion which every student signed up to that course can participate in. Students can also create additional discussion pages such as ones for: different lecture topics, tutorials, past exam help as well as private groups for group work (i.e on a group assignment). Students can provides links to resources that are useful to help understand the course material. Course coordinators and tutors have full access to the applications features including the messaging logs to discourage cheating and plagiarism.

While there are already countless applications and websites that aim to help students and provide resources to students; StudyHub is different in that it allows students to store all of their different account information in one place. From StudyHub students can easily access all of their educational material and content. StudyHub is also designed specifically for students who are unable to engage with their peers currently.  StudyHub will facilitate class discussion and group work as well as provide the ability to easily access countless different external resources. 

## Team 


Our team members include: Sam Lucht, Nicklas Cook, Zach Mansfield, Bob Moses and Michael Du. The team will be run in a democratic manner, with decisions being made using Facebook Messenger polls or during one of the team meetings. The management of the project will happen throughout meetings, with weekly updates on our progress and goals for the future week. Each member is responsible for raising issues and queries to the whole team, but it is still important to come together and discuss all of these as a group.

Zach will be responsible for the logistics, particularly bringing the equipment to each session. For the rest of the roles, Sam will be the head UI designer, Nick will be the User Experience designer, Bob will be the user satisfaction and emotional designer, and Michael is in charge of user testing. 

If a team member is performing poorly, such as not completing their assigned work for the week, initially we will talk about it in the next team meeting. From there, if the lack of work persists, then we will try to talk to them individually about the lack of effort. If a group member is still not performing to an adequate standard; we will contact Lorna and potentially ask to initiate a peer assessment.


## Communication


In-person communication will occur during our workshop hours every Tuesday from 12pm to 2pm. In order to ensure every group member has a chance to speak and have input towards the project, a team meeting will be held at the start of each workshop. The meeting length will depend on how much needs to be discussed in terms of progress, ideas, brainstorming, and any issues members of the team have encountered.

For communication outside of meetings, the team will use both the Facebook group page created, and Facebook messenger. This is to ensure that every member will see any notifications from other team members on both mobile phones and laptops/personal computers. While some file sharing can occur on both the Facebook page and messenger, primary storage and sharing of files will occur on the Google Drive folder created for the group and the groupsâ€™ Github. This is to ensure that every member can access a file at the same time, and if need be, edit it at the same time. Google Drive is also being utilized due to its ability to live chat with other team members working on the same file. 

Files will be named according to the assessment it is required for. Files will be named according to the assessment piece and file version; if the file is part of a github submission. 


## Plan

The project will be completed in 8 weeks as scheduled. The project breaks down to five phases: User research, Paper Prototype Design, User Testing, Design Re-adjustment and Construction. 

### User Research Phase:
Key deliverables: To be completed by the 10th of September. Conduct user research by handing out surveys to students around campus and collect all raw data. Organise and summarise the data to conclude what students want from the application. 
Resources: Survey to be written on Microsoft Word and to be printed out. 

### Paper Prototype Design Phase:
Key deliverables: To be completed by the 17th of September. A paper prototype is needed to demonstrate and test the key functions of the application. First design the wireframe using computer software and then create the paper prototype. 
Resources: Wireframes are created on a wireframe creating tool called Balsamiq and  paperboards are required to create the paper prototype. 

### User Testing Phase:
Key deliverables: To be completed by the 1st of October. Gather test users to test out the paper prototype and collect feedback. Two weeks are allocated to complete this phase because we want to collect the most valuable feedback possible in order to re-adjust the design to truly fit all requirements. 
Resources: Paper prototype, notebooks or laptops to record feedback. 

### Design Re-adjustment Phase:
Key deliverables: To be completed by the 8th of October. Read over the summary from the User Testing phase and iterate the design to meet all requirements. 
Resources: Modify the design on Balsamiq. 

### Construction Phase:
Key deliverables:To be completed by the 27th of October. Construct the application based on the re-adjusted design and run tests to make sure the application works. 
Resources: (insert softwares that we use?)
